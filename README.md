FakeNews Detection using BiLSTM

Overview


This project aims to detect fake news using a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) neural network. The BiLSTM model is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) capable of capturing contextual information from both past and future sequences, making it effective for tasks such as sequence labeling and text classification.

Requirements

Python 3.x

TensorFlow 2.x

Keras

Pandas

NumPy

Scikit-learn

NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)


Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing the model should be in CSV format with two columns: "text" containing the news articles or headlines, and "label" containing the corresponding labels (0 for real news, 1 for fake news).

Usage

Data Preparation: Ensure that your dataset is properly formatted and split into training and testing sets.
Preprocessing: Preprocess the text data by tokenizing, padding sequences, and converting them into numerical representations suitable for input to the BiLSTM model.
Model Training: Train the BiLSTM model using the training data. Fine-tune hyperparameters such as batch size, learning rate, and number of epochs as needed.
Evaluation: Evaluate the trained model on the testing data to assess its performance in terms of metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Inference: Use the trained model to predict the labels of new news articles or headlines and determine whether they are real or fake.
Model Architecture

The BiLSTM model consists of an embedding layer, followed by one or more BiLSTM layers, and finally a dense layer with sigmoid activation for binary classification.

Performance

The performance of the model can vary depending on factors such as the quality and size of the dataset, the architecture of the model, and the choice of hyperparameters. It is recommended to experiment with different configurations and conduct thorough evaluation to determine the optimal settings.
